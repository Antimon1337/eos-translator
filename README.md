# EoS Translator
A tiny tool to translate PMD: Explorers of Skies into other languages a lot less tedious
Now rewritten in C# for Windows & Swift for macOS

--- What EoS Translator does ---
- Copying dialogue lines from a given multilingual file into a monolungual one
- Preparing the files for use in SkyTemple
- Searching for given phrases in multiple files to make looking for specific sections a lot easier

--- What it does not ---
- Being a one-click tool. There's still manual work required. Though I'm planning to add more features over time
- Compiling the translated scripts for direct use in ROM, you still need to use SkyTempe for injecting the scripts into the game
- Translating Hacks with a completly new story. EoS Translator relys on preextracted scripts from the original EU-Verion of EoS. Translating compleatly new dialogues will require some intelligency like Google Translate built in, which is not implementet (yet, maybe)


How to use?

- Download the EoS Translator for your specific machine   Windows (x64/ARM) or macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- If you're on Windows you'll need .NET Runtime 6
- Download the EoS Scripts to get all extracted scripts from the EU-Verison of EoS & Explorers of Skies
- Open EoS Translator and point it to the eu folder of the downloaded scripts and specify which folder should be translated
- Choose the language to translate the scripts into
- CLickl translate
- Enjoy!
